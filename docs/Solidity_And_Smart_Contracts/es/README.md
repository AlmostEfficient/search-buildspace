# Solidity_And_Smart_Contracts (Spanish)

This is the start of the Spanish version of the Solidity And Smart Contracts Project! The structure should look the same as the current structure:

```
- es/
    - Section_0/
        - {LESSONS}
    - Section_1/
        - {LESSONS}
    - Section_2/
        - {LESSONS}
    - Section_3/
        - {LESSONS}
    - Section_4/
        - {LESSONS}
```
